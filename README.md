# Company Vehicle
The objective of this Uniremington university project is to create an application that allows the calculation of vehicle rental prices from a rental company. To carry out this project, Python and Django have been used.

Although the requested prompts were successfully completed, certain additional features are still required to be implemented to improve the user experience. For example, functions to delete and update information would be needed, as well as some filters to make it easier to search for vehicles.

In short, this Uniremington university project uses Python and Django to develop an application that calculates car rental prices from a rental company. New features are being explored to improve the user experience and make the app even more useful and convenient.

## For this project is required:
    1. Python3 v3.8.10
    2. package manager pip v20.0.2
    3. Mysql
## Clone repository
##### git clone https://github.com/nessamoreno/companyVehicle.git
## How to Install
#### 1. Create a virtual environment
- Create a virtual Python environment for the project. You can do it using the following command in the terminal:
    **python3 -m venv virtual_environment_name**

- Activate the virtual environment. In the terminal, run the following command:
    **source virtual_environment_name/bin/activate**

***Remember to replace `virtual_environment_name` with whatever name you have chosen for the virtual environment***

- Once the virtual environment is up, you need to install the Django and Python dependencies. To do this, you can use the following command:
    ***pip install -r requirements.txt***
**This command will install all the necessary dependencies for the project, which are found in the requirements.txt file.**
   
#### 2. Verify the deployment by navigation
-After the installations are complete, you are ready to start the Django development server to test the project. To start the server, use the following command:
##### python3 manage.py runserver
##### http://127.0.0.1:8000/

#### 3. Modify env file for database connection
Despite having successfully completed the indications requested for the project, it is necessary to implement some additional functions to improve the functionality and aesthetics of the application. Among the functions that must be implemented are the possibility of deleting and updating information, as well as the inclusion of some filters that allow a more efficient search of available vehicles.

Implementing these additional features will not only improve the user experience when using the app, but will also ensure that the car rental company can manage its inventory more efficiently and effectively. With these improvements, the application will be even more useful and practical for users and will help the company to provide better service to its customers.
